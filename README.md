# TTSpaceMouse

This is a small implementation of the TTSpaceMouse Pro Micro based DIY SpaceMouse.
As the josticks (4 of them) are quite in-accuarate as well as much slack before move is detected, I 
decided to make my own version where I am trying to detect "major moves" and decrease other detected
movements. The idea is to somewhat boost the "major detected" move in order to make it easier to use.

Feel free to use this code here for any kind of purpose (except blaming me for bad idea, bad code etc...)
